# Useless-Machine
Here you can find informations (schema, circuitry, materials) to create your own useless box.

## Materials
- (x1) Continuous rotation servo motor
- (x1) DPDT toggle switch
- (x1) SPDT lever switch
- (x1) 3 x AA battery holder
- (x1) Small hinged wooden box
- (x1) Wooden letter ('C' or 'J' tends to work well)
- (x1) 1" wood cube
- (x1) Wood glue

## Creating the Circuit
This is the simple circuit I used. As you see when the lever switches the motor is active, then when the switch is ficked by the wooden letter, the motor goes the other direction until it hits the switch.

## Wiring the Circuit
Follow this diagram while wiring the circuit according the the connections above.

## Install all the Parts
Use the wood glue to install all of the connected parts into the wooden box. You will have to make a diagonal cut of the box, attach the wooden letter to the servo moter, and drill a hole for the switch.
